# Interest-1

My interest in IT started about 10 years ago when I first met my friend who was really into his computers & programming, he then showed me a lot about them & how much you can do with them, so I started to get more interested in them as time went by. A few years later I really wanted to get into IT but never knew where to start until I heard about Open Universities Australia, so I decided to have a look there & thats when i decided to enroll into a bachelor in IT course.
